<h1 align="center">A history of surfing</h1>

<p>Surfing is an amazing sport with an impressive history. The exact origins of surfing are not certain, but it was
  first observed by Europeans on a ship in Tahiti back in 1767.</p>

<p>Research suggests that surfing dates back to the ancient Polynesian cultures that existed long ago. According to data
  collected and many myths, the chief of a tribe was the man who could surf the best.</p>
